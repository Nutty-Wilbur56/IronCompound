    <h2>VPN server</h2>

    <h3>Encryption of Communication</h3>
    <article>
        When a client initiates a connection to the server, both the server and client have to verify each others
        identity.

    <h2>Intrusion Prevention System: The Legionnaire</h2>
    <article>
        Unlike other VPNs, IronCompound utilizes an integrated Intrusion Prevention System; The Legionnaire,
        to monitor threats against the VPN server. What is an Intrusion Prevention System, you may ask...Intrusion
        Detection
        Systems are like advanced firewalls, but at the same time different. Intrusion Prevention Systems filter network
        traffic
        to root out malicious packets and or activity. Unlike regular firewalls that root out just the malicious
        packets,
        IPS's (at least mine is) are capable of barring potentially malicious clients from connecting to a server,
        router, or
        any other networking device. So far, the Legionnaire is designed to filter for SYN flood attacks and ICMP echo
        flood
        attacks. Apart from monitoring attacks, the IPS is also where most of the logging of security violations take
        place.
        Simple interactions with the server, such as initial connection, are logged with the server. One more use for
        that the IPS does is
        it tracks the list of active clients. The server, as previously mentioned, also tracks the amount of clients but
        for
        different purposes.

    <h3>Artificial Intelligence</h3>
    <article>
        As described previously, The Legionnaire monitors network traffic for SYN flooding and ICMP echo
        flooding. In order for the Legionnaire to learn to filter for these attacks, the IPS is paired with a machine
        learning pipeline. As
        of right now the AI pipeline is fairly simple and rudimentary, given that the session data I am feeding the
        pipeline
        is pseudo data.

    <h3>Session Tracking</h3>
    <article>
        Session tracking is part of the aforementioned rule policy engine.
    </article>

    <h3>Violation Manager</h3>
    <article>
        The violation manager is where violations are logged and actions set by the rule policy engine are enforced.
        For the violation manager to commit to a reprehensible action, clients have to cross specific thresholds
    </article>

    <h2>Rule Policy Engine: Caesar</h2>
    <article>
        Caesar, The Legionnaire's rule policy engine is a centralization of registering and adding the rules that The
        Legionnaire enforces.
        The engine also evaluates sessions every time a client interacts with the server.
